# Micro Front Ends

For now a simple portal with cdn and micro front ends, serving product cards.

## Run project locally

For each app, open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```
npm i
npm start
```

You can find the content of a product card at http://localhost:3002, and repeated product cards in the portal at http://localhost:3001

The CDN serving static content is available at http://localhost:3000
